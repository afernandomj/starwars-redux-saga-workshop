# starwars-redux-saga-workshop

This workshop is a basic react app with redux saga, in which I added side effects,
by implementing generators functions.
I've explored commands that redux saga provides, and I understood what is the difference between blocking and non-blocking actions.
I understood how to run concurrently sagas with the saga helpers and how to wire up everything with the redux store, I finished to implement unit testing for the sagas.
